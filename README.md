# Rich Client Platform for .NET

The Rich Client Platform for .NET is similar to the NetBeans Platform and the Eclipse RCP for Java, enabling development of windows-based applications on top of the IDE containing customizable menus, dock panels, and tabbed documents. The platform is derived from the open-source FlashDevelop IDE for developing Flash Actionscript - http://www.flashdevelop.org.

The platform uses a plugin architecture where the plugins are loaded separately at runtime. Build the whole solution before running to load all the plugins.
